# 🧠 JavaScript Concepts Playground

This repository is dedicated to **revisiting and reinforcing core JavaScript concepts** — from the fundamentals to more advanced topics.

Whether it's:
- ✅ Data Types
- ✅ Functions & Scope
- ✅ DOM Manipulation
- ✅ ES6+ Features (let/const, arrow functions, destructuring, promises, async/await, etc.)
- ✅ And more...

This space serves as a **learning log**, where I:
- Document my understanding
- Practice with real code snippets
- Build a stronger, clearer grasp on the language that powers the web 🌐
